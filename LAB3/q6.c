/* C program that accepts (from the keyboard) positive decimal fraction can be expressed in binary system as 0.x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 · · ·, where x i ’s are either zero or one. Write a C program that accepts (from the keyboard) a
positive decimal fraction and prints out at most first four bits of the equivalent binary
representation. For example if the decimal fraction is 0.1, then the program should
print 0.0001· · ·. On the other hand, if the decimal fraction is 0.125, then the program
should print 0.001. The program must also print an error message if the input number
is not a positive decimal fraction.
