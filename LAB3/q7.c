/* C program that Compute the roots of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. The roots are real
if the discriminant D = b^2 − 4ac is non-negative. If the discriminant is negative, then the roots are complex conjugate .

Input : It accepts the values of a, b and c from the keyboard.
Output :No solution if both a and b are zero. The program finishes with appropriate
				message.
				Linear equation if a = 0 but b 6 = 0 and the root is −c/b. The program prints out
				the root with appropriate message and the program finishes.
