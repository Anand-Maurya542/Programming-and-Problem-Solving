/* C program that reads a decimal number between 0 and 32 exclusive can be expressed in binary system as
x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 x 0 , where x i â€™s are either zero or one. Write a C program that accepts (from
the terminal) a decimal number in the above range and prints out the equivalent binary
representation. For example if the decimal is 17, then the program should print 10001.
The program must also print an error message if the input is outside the range.
